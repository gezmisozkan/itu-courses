\section{INTRODUCTION }
Data operations that are done with registers are called microoperations. To obtain the results of these operations Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU) are used in the CPU. In this project, we have learned the working principle of this system. Then, we used Verilog to create an ALU system and examined its process. After the implementation, using test files, the simulation has been analyzed.


\section{MATERIALS AND METHODS }
We used our Digital Design knowledge and slides that were provided by lecturers. We have provided the essential screenshots and explanations in this section.

\subsection{PART 1}

In this section, the n-bit register has been designed to use for different purposes. Outputs of the register are controlled with FunSel and Enable (E) inputs.

\end{figure}
\end{itemize}



\subsection{PART 2}
\subsubsection{PART 2.A}
Instruction register (IR) using additional low/high signal that indicates the Most Significant and Least Significant bits have been created.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{PART 2.B}
Using general purpose and temporary registers,  we built a system that takes inputs such as O1Sel, O2Sel, FunSel, RSel, and TSel; gives outputs as O1 and O2 with n-bit registers that we implemented in first part.

\section{RESULTS [15 points]}
ADD RESULTSSSSSSSSSSSSSS


\section{DISCUSSION [25 points]}
Firstly,  we analyzed the project as a group and decided what our steps needs to be to create our ALU project. We divided our work into parts. However, after a while, we figured out that working on parts separately will be more stressful and difficult due to preparing the parts and include to each other, etc. After that, we worked together on the parts. We created the logic designs and write Verilog codes cooperatively for all the parts. We have difficulties from time to time while we trying to understand registers and the systems, but eventually, we analyzed correctly. We finished our project slightly early before the due time. However, we waited until the testbench typos were resolved.

\section{CONCLUSION [10 points]}
In this project, firstly; we have built an n-bit register and used it to create an instruction register (IR), general purpose, and temporary registers. Then, we used it for implementing an address register file including different types of registers such as program counter (PC), address register (AR), stack pointer (SP), and the past program counter (PCPast). Finally, using these parts, Arithmetic Logic Unit has been implemented and after the organization of the system, the performance of the whole system has been observed with the same clock signal.
